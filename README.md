# leptospirosis-status-of-the-patient-Prediction
Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease, meaning it can be transmitted from animals to humans. This project, we will use the leptospirosis_dataset to develop a machine learning model that can predict the leptospirosis status of the patient (1-confirmed, 2-not detected) based on some symptoms, clinical tests, demographic details, etc.
