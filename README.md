# leptospirosis-status-of-the-patient-Prediction
Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease, meaning it can be transmitted from animals to humans. This project, we will use the leptospirosis_dataset to develop a machine learning model that can predict the leptospirosis status of the patient (1-confirmed, 2-not detected) based on some symptoms, clinical tests, demographic details, etc.

# Data
the leptospirosis_dataset contains data of 1387 patients related to leptospirosis and 806 variables. The variable “Final” (last column) reports the leptospirosis status of the patient (1-confirmed, 2-not detected).

# NOTE 
the dataset contains many NA values. so this is best approach to handle missing values and NAs

# Test Accuracy
at the end of the code of  you can get the test prediction, then upload it to the Kaggle competition opened by my university to look the test accuracy from this link https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/st40352023/leaderboard
